# Graphs in Data Structure
### A non-linear data structure which contains a set of objects where some objects are connected to others with links, links are called edges and those objects are called vertices in programming aspect.
### Graph can be called a abstract data type which is used to implement the graphs of mathematics.
### In mathematics graph G is composed by set of N vertices or node connected through a set of E edges or links. ```G=(V,E)```
#### Edges are represented by ```e = [u,v]``` where ```u``` and ```v``` are adjacent nodes/vertices and called end points of e.
#### A path ```P``` of length ```n``` from a node ```u``` to a node ```v``` is defined as a sequence of ```n+1``` nodes
